Reflection:
In this project I learned about many new tools and concepts such as the openCV library and how to use it in conjunction with external devices such as a webcam. Another skill I learned was to tbe able to do real time inferencing rather than inferencing on static images, though a skill I was able to improve was inferenceing as through this project I was able to learn about different optimizations that could be applicable and i was able to improve my ability to code and troubleshoot which are essential areas applicable to my future career and studies. The researching aspect of the project went well as we where able to find many guides and existing code that we could easily restructure to fit our use case and one particular strategy was look at the documentation, be it the github or websites for the frameworks and selected models to be able to understant or find code we could use to test/modify out existing code. There were many challenges encountered in this project
