Reflection

While doing this project, I have gained a large array of skills in working with embedded edge devices which in this case is the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.
I also learned how to set up a real-time AI inferencing pipeline using GPU acceleration. When it comes to hands on experience, I learned to work 
with tools like JetPack, TensorRT, Ultralytics YOLOv5 and OpenCV. I have even learned hot to flash the microSD and  set up a Linux environment using 
PuTTY. I have improved my skills in Python especially with integrating hte use of a camera in an AI model. I also improved my ability to analyze the 
perfomance of the system using Jtop and make the necessary  changes if criteria was not satisfactory. With these skills, I am able to apply them to 
areas like robotics where I can integrate sensors through coding and optimize its efficiency in movement and power usage with what I have learned.
The same skills can be appled also to autonomous system for vehicles or others machinery, as well as AI for IoT devices as they would use a similar
process to set up, train and analyse data.

The aspects of this project that went particalularly well was the setting up of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano 6.1 device especially with connecting the
system to a network. THe strategies we went about doing this was first via ethernet cable whicg presented some complexity, then I moved on to using PuTTY
which made the process alot easier as I can directly interact witht the NVIDIA system using a different computer. There, we still could not connect the 
network properly so we set up the system to display through a monitor where the Wifi connection can be directly interacted with to use th edu-guest Wifi. 

The challenegs during this project would be finding the right packages that are compatible with the the model we were using as there were errors than were continuouslt reoccuring over time for example with the numpy package. Here I assisted with testing different versions of the numpy package until the system was able to recognize and use it. I have also assisted with similar problems but for other packages as well in order to solve this recurring issue.


Learning plan:
As I worked more on this project,I have come to realize that I eeded a much deeper understanding of CUDA programming and GPU optimization, TensorRT model conversion and improving performance especially on edge devices. If I were to scale this to a lerger or industrial project, I would most likely need to gain an understanding in good practices for deploying edge AI as it can do alot of damage in a short time if not done properly and I believe I would need to explore other models so I can quickly reference an appropriate model depending on the task at hadn for better use of computing resoruces. To be equipped, I would take more courses especially online on CUDA programming as being able to optimze on a program level would have siginificant benefits, also practice with using TensorRT,ONNX and similar framworks to improve flexibility, Lastly  would study more on ROS 2 integration as communication between devices are very common nowadays.
