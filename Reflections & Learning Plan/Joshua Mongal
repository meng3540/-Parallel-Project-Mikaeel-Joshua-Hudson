While doing this projet, I have gained a large array of skills in working with embedded edge devices which in this case is the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.
I also learned how to set up a real-time AI inferencing pipeline using GPU acceleration. When it comes to hands on experience, I learned to work 
with tools like JetPack, TensorRT, Ultralytics YOLOv5 and OpenCV. I have even learned hot to flash the microSD and  set up a Linux environment using 
PuTTY. I have improved my skills in Python especially with integrating hte use of a camera in an AI model. I also improved my ability to analyze the 
perfomance of the system using Jtop and make the necessary  changes if criteria was not satisfactory. With these skills, I am able to apply them to 
areas like robotics where I can integrate sensors through coding and optimize its efficiency in movement and power usage with what I have learned.
The same skills can be appled also to autonomous system for vehciles or others machinery, as well as AI for IoT devices as they would use a similar
process to set up, train and analyse data.

The aspects of this project that went particalularly well was the setting up of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano 6.1 device especially with connecting the
system to a network. THe stregies we went about doing this was first via ethernet cable whicg presented some complexity, then I moved on to using PuTTY
which made the process alot easier as I can directly interact witht the NVIDIA system using a different computer. There, we still could not connect the 
network properly so we set up the system to dispalay through a monitor where the Wifi connection can be directly interacgted with to use th edu-guest Wifi.
